Write a program which reads a string from the standard input stdin, reverses it and then writes it to 
the standard output stdout.
â€¢ The program should be started from npm script via nodemon (i.e. npm run task1).
â€¢ The program should be running in a stand-by mode and should not be terminated after the 
first-string processing.
